## Understanding The User
As a group we decided to build a system around the online shopping experience by creating an online store for clothing. Our first priority was to understand our users. Together we devised **10 user stories** to identify features to include in our app.</br></br>

## UML Diagrams
At this point of the project, we all had our individual roles. I assigned the creation of the **UML diagrams** to one of my team members, although we collectively had to understand and critique each diagram to ensure the right information is presented.</br>
The UML diagrams helped to capture each relationship and visualise the flow of the system. They were created using **StarUML**.</br>

## Competitive Analysis
Before designing our product, I did research on existing online stores. I mainly focused on Shein, Bershka and Temu as they were the most popular clothing stores. During my analysis, I identified each of their strengths and weaknesses and from that saw opportunities for our own app.</br>
Out of the three, Bershka's UI was the best as you can clearly see the products they're selling. I am also able to filter for the item I'm searching for, and the fonts/buttons weren't too small. This was the application I drew inspiration from.</br></br>
