## Understanding The User
As a group we decided to build a system around the online shopping experience by creating an online store for clothing. Our first priority was to understand our users. Together we devised **10 user stories** to identify features to include in our app.</br></br>

## UML Diagrams
At this point of the project, we all had our individual roles. I assigned the creation of the **UML diagrams** to one of my team members, although we collectively had to understand and critique each diagram to ensure the right information is presented.</br>
The UML diagrams helped to capture each relationship and visualise the flow of the system. They were created using **StarUML**.</br>

## Competitive Analysis
Before designing our product, I did research on existing online stores. I mainly focused on Shein, Bershka and Temu as they were the most popular clothing stores. During my analysis, I identified each of their strengths and weaknesses and from that saw opportunities for our own app.</br></br>
Out of the three, Bershka's UI was the best as you can clearly see the products they're selling. I am also able to filter for the item I'm searching for, and the fonts/buttons weren't too small. This was the application I drew inspiration from.</br></br>

## User Interface Design
I started the design process by drawing **low-fidelity** wireframes on paper, focusing on the functionality rather than appearance.</br></br>

### <ins>**Inspiration**</ins>
What particularly inspired me about Bershka's design is its minimalistic style. The use of neutral colours allows the images to stand out, making it easy for the user to navigate through the app.</br></br>

### <ins>**Nova**</ins>
Following my wireframes and the inspired colour scheme, I created the user interface for our online store, NOVA. I used **Balsamiq** for designing each page.</br><h5>(Images and logo was sourced from [Pinterest](https://ar.pinterest.com/pin/796855727798808595/).)</h5></br>
